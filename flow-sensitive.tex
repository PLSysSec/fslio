\section{Flow-sensitivity extensions}
\label{sec:flow-sensitive}

\concept{a more-LIO focused example for why FS}
Unfortunately the flow-insensitive references described in the previous section
are somewhat inflexible.
%
Consider, for example, an application that uses a reference as a log.
%
Since the log may contain sensitive information, it is important that the
reference be labeled.
%
Equally important is to be able to read the log at any point in the program to,
for instance, save it to a file.
%
While labeling the reference with the maximum element in the label lattice
$\top$ would always allow writes to the log, and |toLabeled| can be used to
write the log to a file, this is unsatisfactory: it assumes the existence of a
maximum element, which in practical IFC systems such as Hails~\tocite{}, does
not exist.
%
Moreover, it almost always over-approximates the sensitivity of the
log---suppose that the computation never reads sensitive data, yet wishes to
read the log content to, e.g., format it: it needs to taint itself to $\top$!
%
It is clear that even in the case of simple scenarios, having references with
mutable labels that vary according to the sensitive of what is stored in the
reference is useful.

\concept{naive approach doesn't work}
However, naively implementing flow-sensitive references can effectively
introduce the implicit problem of other language-based system to LIO.
%
Suppose that we allow for the label of a reference to simply be raised to the
current label at the time a |writeRef space| is performed.
%
So, for example, if the label of our log reference is |low| and the computation
has read sensitive data such that the current label is |H|, now writing to the
log raises the label of the reference to |H|.
%
While this approach was clearly shown to be unsafe, due to implicit-flows, in
language-based systems~\tocite{}, LIO eliminates the implicit-flows problem by
construction and thus raises the question: \emph{is this approach safe in LIO?}
%
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is \emph{no}; consider the code
in Figure~\ref{fig:fs-attack}, below:
%
\begin{figure}[h!]
\small
\begin{code}
leakRef :: LIORefTCB space Bool -> LIO Bool
leakRef href = do
  tmp   <- newRef space low ()
  toLabeled high $ do  h <- readRef space href
                       when h (writeRef space tmp ())
  return (labelOfR tmp == high)
\end{code}
\cut{$}
\caption{Attack in LIO with naive flow-sensitive reference extension. We ommit
subscripts on reference terminals for clarity.  \label{fig:fs-attack}}
\end{figure}

\concept{can leak into ref label}
\noindent
%
Here, |leakRef| can be used to leak the value stored in a |high| reference
|href|, while keeping the current label |low|, by leveraging the new
implicit-flow channel: the label of references.
%
Concretely, in |leakRef| we create a public reference |tmp| and withing the
|toLabeled| block, which is used to ensure that the current label remains
|low|, the label of this reference is changed to |H| if the secret stored in
|href| is |true|, and left intact (|L|) if the secret is |false|.
%
Then, simply inspecting the label of the reference reveals the value stored in
|href|!
%
We note that the use of |labelOfR space| is not fundamental to this attack; in
Appendix~\ref{sec:app:fs-attack2} we show an alternative version of |leakRef|
that does not rely on label inspection.

\hl{KEY INSIGHT:}
Fundamentally, the label protecting the \emph{label} of an object (e.g.,
labeled values and references) is the current label |lcurr| at the time of
creation.
%
Hence, to modify the label of the object within some context (e.g., |toLabeled|
block) wherein the current label is |lcurr'| it must be that the |lcurr'
canFlowTo lcurr|, i.e., we must be able to write data at sensitivity level
|lcurr'| into an entity (the label) labeled |lcurr|.
%
This is especially important if we can restore the current label from |lcurr'|
to |lcurr| and subsequently observe the leak within the program itself.
%
In the case where the label of the object is immutable, as is the case for
labeled values and flow-insensitive references, this is not a concern: even if
the current label is raised to |lcurr'| and then restored to |lcurr| we do not
learn any information more sensitive than |lcurr| (the label of the label at
the time of creation) by inspecting the label: the label has not changed!
%

\concept{\liofs{}}
Thus, to extend LIO with flow-sensitive reference we must account for the label
on the label of the reference at the time of creation, |lcurr|.
%
(This label is, however, immutable.)
%
In turn, when changing the label of the reference, we must ensure that no data
from the context at the time of the change, whose label is |lcurr'|, is leaked
into the label of the reference by ensuring that |lcurr' canFlowTo lcurr|,
i.e., we can write data labeled |lcurr'| into the label labeled |lcurr|.
%
Formally, we extend the \lio{} syntax as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sos:refs},
with |s=S|, and Figure~\ref{fig:sos:fs};
%
the reduction rules for this extended calculus, called \liofs{}, are also
given in Figure~\ref{fig:sos:fs}.

\concept{\liofs{} semantics}
When creating a flow-sensitive reference, |newRef S l t| creates a labeled
value that guards |t| with label |l| (|LabeledTCB l t|).
%
However, since we wish to to allow programmers to modify the label |l| of the
reference, we additionally store the label on |l|, i.e., |lcurr|, by simply
labeling the already-guarded term, as as shown in rule~\ruleref{newRef-|S|}.
%
|newRef S| returns a |LIORefTCB S a| which simply encapsulates the fresh
reference address where the doubly-labeled term is stored.
%
Note that this values from the flow-insensitive case in not encapsulating the
label of the reference.
%
This is precisely because the label of a flow-sensitive reference is not
mutable and must be looked up in the store.
%
As given by rule~\ruleref{labelOf-|S|}, |labelOfR S| returns the label of the
reference after raising the current label (with |unlabel|) to account for the
fact that the label of the reference |l'| is a value at sensitivity level |l|,
i.e., we raise the current label to the join of the current label and the label
on the label.
%
The rules for reading and writing to flow-sensitive refernces are standard;
|readRef S| raise the current label to the label of the reference (which is
above the label on the label) and |writeRef S| ensure that the current
computation can write to the reference.
%
Note that |writeRef S| does not modify the label of the reference.
%
This is, in part, because we wish to keep the inferace between flow-insensitive
and flow-sensitive references as close as possible.
%
Instead, we provide |upgradeR| precisely for this purpose; this primitive is
used to raise the label of the reference.
%
Importantly it ensures that the current computation can modify the label by
checking that the current label flows to the label on the label (|lcurr
canFlowTo l'|).



%%This problem can be addressed in several ways. Prior work proposed the
%%\emph{no-sensitive-upgrade} strategy~\citep{?} and the
%%\emph{permissive-upgrade} strategy~\citep{?}. The no-sensitive-upgrade
%%check forbids assignment to a public reference in a secret context. In
%%contrast, the permissive-upgrade check allows the assignment but marks
%%it as a partial leak; if there is a subsequent conditional branch on
%%partially leaked data, the program stops.  We adapt the
%%permissive-upgrade idea to our floating-label model, which results in
%%a slightly more permissive enforcement that allows the conditional
%%branch.
%%
%%In order to express our flow-sensitive enforcement, we extend the
%%formalization of |LIO| to include flow-sensitive LIORefs with an
%%|upgrade| operation. Figure~\ref{fig:fs-exts-syntax} introduces the
%%syntax for values, terms and types that we require in order to account
%%for both flow-sensitive and flow-insensitive references.
%%
%%The expression |m1 merge m2| merges the two stores, using elements
%%from |m1| to override those of |m2|.

% Figure~\ref{fig:fs-exts-semantics} introduces the semantics for LIORef
% operations. Rule $\textsc{NewRef}$ creates a new LIORef with a given
% initial label and value, adding it to the mutable reference store
% $\RTS$. The following rules come in two versions, one for
% flow-insensitive variables and another one for flow-sensitive ones,
% marked as $\textsc{FI}$ and $\textsc{FS}$ respectively. Rules
% $\textsc{ReadRef-FI}$, $\textsc{WriteRef-FI}$ and
% $\textsc{LabelOf-FI}$ are exactly like in previous versions of the
% library. In rule $\textsc{ReadRef-FS}$, in addition to the usual
% tainting of the current label $\env.\lbl$, we have a taint on
% $\env.\fel$, which is used to keep track of the taint caused by
% flow-sensitive variables within |toLabeled| blocks. Rule
% $\textsc{WriteRef-FS}$ causes the label in the flow-sensitive
% reference to be replaced by the current label, allowing operations
% that would otherwise trigger a security violation exception on a
% flow-insensitive variable. Rule $\textsc{LabelOf-FS}$ works by
% tainting the current label with the label of the reference being
% inspected, before returning this label.

% Figure~\ref{fig:toLabeled-semantics} shows the reduction rule for

% (due to flow-sensitive references) to be taken into account in future

\begin{definition}
We define the equivalence relation oblivious to flow-sensitive reference
implemnetation as:
\begin{itemize}
\item |LIORefTCB S t &=  LIORefTCB S t'| for any |t|, |t'|.
\item |t &=  t'| iff |t = t'|.
\item |LIOTCB t &=  LIOTCB t'| iff |t &=  t'|.
\item |LabeledTCB l t &= LabeledTCB l t'| iff |t &=  t'| and |l &=  l'|.
\item etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Equivalence]
For all |t, v| in \lio{} and |t', v'| in \liofs{},
and |v &= v'|, it must be that
%
|conf (lcurr,mI) t  ==> conf (lcurr',...) diverge| $\Leftrightarrow$
|conf (lcurr,mI,emptyset) t' ==> conf (lcurr',...) diverge| and 
%
|conf (lcurr,mI) t  ==> conf (lcurr',...) v| $\Leftrightarrow$
|conf (lcurr,mI,emptyset) t' ==> conf (lcurr',...) v'|.
