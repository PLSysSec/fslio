\section{Conclusions}

We show an extension of LIO with flow-sensitive references. Our approach allows
secure label changes, and includes |upgrade| operations to boost
permissiveness. As a programmer, introducing upgrade operations might be
cumbersome. In order to reduce that burden, we propose automatically inserting
them at convenient places, i.e., when the floating label is raised.
Importantly, our design approach is its ability to directly extend to a
concurrent setting.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
address the problem of label changes for a concurrent language, where IFC is
enforced by a purely dynamic monitor.  A key insight of this work is to show
that, both for the sequential and concurrent settings, it is possible to encode
our techniques for flow-sensitivity in terms of flow-insensitive
concepts---this is due to the ability of LIO to handle nested labeled values.
As a consequence, soundness of our extension is reduced to previous results on
LIO.
