\section{Conclusions}

We show an extension of LIO with flow-sensitive references. Our approach allows
secure label changes, and includes |upgrade| operations to boost
permissiveness. As a programmer, introducing upgrade operations might be
cumbersome. In order to reduce that burden, we propose automatically inserting
them at convenient places, i.e., when the floating label is raised. For
concurrent systems, we slightly adapt our notion of upgrade to avoid failure,
i.e., upgrading labels does not stop execution. This difference is crucial for
avoiding the termination channel, which might leak data at a relatively high
rate in the presence of threads. A key insight of this work is to show that,
both for the sequential and concurrent settings, it is possible to encode our
techniques for flow-sensitivity in terms of flow-insensitive concepts---this is
due to the ability of LIO to handle nested labeled values. As a consequence,
soundness of our extension is reduced to previous
results~\cite{stefan:lio,stefan:addressing-covert}. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first one to address the problem of label changes
for a concurrent language, where IFC is enforced by a purely dynamic monitor.
