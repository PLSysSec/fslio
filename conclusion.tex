\section{Conclusions}

We show an extension for LIO with flow-sensitive references. Our approach
implements the {\nsu} policy for label changes, and contains upgrade operations
to boost permissiveness. As a programmer, introducing upgrade operations might
be tiresome. To reduce that burden, we propose convenient places where to
automatically insert them, i.e., when the floating-label is raised. For
concurrent systems, we slightly adapt our notion of upgrade to avoid failure,
i.e., upgrading labels does not stop execution. This difference it is important
to avoid the termination channel, which might leak data at a high rate in
presence of threads. A key insight of this work is to show that, either for the
sequential and concurrent setting, it is possible to provide the discipline {\nsu}
and upgrade operations in terms of flow-insensitive concepts---this is due to 
the ability of LIO to handle nested labeled values. As a consequence,
soundness of our extension is reduced to previous
results~\cite{stefan:lio,stefan:addressing-covert}. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first one to address the problem of label changes
for a concurrent language, where IFC is enforced by a purely dynamic monitor.
