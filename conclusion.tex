\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented an extension of LIO with flow-sensitive references.
%
As in previous flow-sensitive work, our approach allows secure label
changes using an |upgrade| operation, as a way to boost the
permissiveness of the IFC system, i.e., |upgrade| can be used to
allows for the encoding of programs that would otherwise be rejected.
%
Since manually inserting |upgrade| operations can be cumbersome, we
extend the calculus to automatically insert upgrades whenever the
current label is raised, while still giving programmers fine-grained
control over which references untrusted code can upgrade.
%
Importantly, our approach naturally extends to a concurrent setting.
%
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the
problem of flow-sensitive label changes for a concurrent, purely
dynamic IFC language.
%
A key insight of this work was to show that, by leveraging nested
labeled objects, both the sequential and concurrent calculi with
flow-sensitive references can be encoded in terms of flow-insensitive
concepts.
%
As a consequence, our soundness proof was reduced to an invocation of
previous results for LIO.
