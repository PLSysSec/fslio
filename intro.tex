\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%% Information-flow control as a promising technology 
Information-flow control (IFC) emerges as a promising technology to preserve
confidentiality and integrity of data in presence of untrusted code.  In
particular, it has become attractive for web applications
~\citep[e.g.][]{DeGroef:2012:FWB:2382196.2382275, giffin:hails,
  yang:2013:towards, conf/esorics/AkhaweLHSS13, Hedin13} and mobile phone
platforms ~\citep[e.g.][]{Enck:2010,android:esorics13}, where the challenge is
to allow untrusted code to access confidential information while restricting its
manipulation.

% Intro to non-interference 
IFC focus on preventing, or limiting, leaks of secret data into public
channels. When no leaks are desired, the chosen baseline policy is
\emph{non-interference}~\citep{Goguen:Meseguer:Noninterference}, which 
essentially demands no dependence of public events on secrets. In scenarios where
non-interference is a strong policy, means for declassification, or intended
release of information, are introduced~\citep{Sabelfeld:Sands:CSFW05}. In this
article, we focus on \emph{non-interference}. 

%% Language-based enforcement 
Recently, it has become popular to provide language-based IFC enforcements in
the form of execution monitors~\citep{Hedin2011}. This decision is mainly
motivated by (i) the permissiveness of dynamic techniques over static
ones~\citep{Sabelfeld:Russo:PSI09}, and (ii) the simplicity for treating notions
like dynamic code evaluation---a feature commonly present in modern scripting
languages. To fulfill confidentiality demands, IFC monitors maintain a
mapping from variables to security labels~\citep{myers:dlm,Stefan:2011}.  For
simplicity of exposition, we consider only two labels: \high (high), which
denotes secrets, and \low (low), which denotes public data. The partial ordering
$\low \canflow \high$ and $\high \not \canflow \low$ expresses that information
can only flow from public data into secret entities.

%% Treatment of variables 
%% Definition flow-sensitive, flow-insensitive 
One of the facets to IFC analysis lies in the treatment of
variables~\citep{Hunt:2006}. Some analyzes, called \emph{flow-insensitive},
forbid variables to change its security labels at execution time, i.e., labels
are treated as \emph{immutable}. In contrast, \emph{flow-sensitive} enforcements
admit changes on labels to reflect the confidentiality of the stored
data, i.e., labels are considered as \emph{mutable}. For instance, assuming secret
variable $h$ and function $\mathit{publish}(v)$, which produce a public event of
value $v$, the program $P = h := 0 ; \mathit{publish}(h)$ is accepted by such an
enforcement since the label associated to $h$ changed to $L$ after the first
assignment ($h := 0$).

%Although static flow-sensitive and flow-insensitive analysis are
%equivalent in expressiveness (module code rewriting)~\citep{Hunt:2006}, the 
%situation is not as clear for purely dynamic analysis.

%% Why one instead of the other one 
%%%%% FS+ Permissiveness in dynamic approaches, limited resources, 
Flow-sensitive analyzes are beneficial for different reasons. In presence of
scarce resources, for instance CPU registers, it is not feasible to think that
they will be assigned a fixed security label throughout program
execution~\citep{BonelliCM05}. More importantly, flow-sensitivite analyses often
boost permissiveness by leveraging the changes on labels to reduce the number of
rejected programs (recall program $P$ above). Unfortunately, purely dynamic IFC
systems can turn label changes into a covert channel~\citep{Russo:2010}. To
close it, there exists mainly three different proposals:
incorporate some static analysis/information into the execution
monitor~\citep{Russo:2010,stefan:lio,10.1109/SP.2013.10}, forbid certain label
changes ---a policy known as \emph{no-sensitive
  upgrades}~\citep{Austin:Flanagan:PLAS10}---, and deny branches on certain
variables which have mutated their labels---a policy named \emph{permissive
  upgrades}~\citep{Austin:Flanagan:PLAS10}. All of these solutions are proposed
for sequential programming languages.


%% Operating system community
Before the apparition of language-based techniques for IFC, the operating system
community has traditionally handle the problem inherent to combine mutable
labels and purely dynamic monitors. Modern examples of that are the operating
systems Asbestos~\citep{Efstathopoulos:2005}, HiStar~\citep{zeldovich:histar},
and Flume~\citep{krohn:flume}. In a nutshell, those systems are composed of
subjects (e.g. processes) and objects (e.g. files or sockets) with security
labels. While security labels for objects are immutable, labels for subjects can
be changed---often by a more restrictive one. Making label changes implicit
(e.g. as a result of observing data from objects) is known as
\emph{tainting}. Subjects' labels restrict read and write actions in order to
preserve confidentiality. For instance, if a process reads a file labeled as
\high, it gets tainted and its label becomes \high, which makes it unable to
write into public files. As before, changing labels might become a covert
channel itself. To avoid it, HiStar and Flume require label changes to be done
explicitly.  Asbestos, on the other hand, allows changes in security labels as
the result of receiving messages under specific and safe conditions. Different
form language-based approaches, OS work rarely comes with soundness guarantees
(except from \citep{Krohn,seL4IF}). Bare in mind that an operating system is not
a simple piece of software to prove correct.


%% LIO brings together OS and LB  
{\LIO} is a IFC system that brings ideas from the OS domain into a language-based
setting~\citep{stefan:lio,stefan:addressing-covert}.  {\LIO} is a floating-label
system, where the label of a computation can be safely raised to accommodate
reading sensitive data. This action can be seen as raising the program counter
(\emph{pc}) in more traditional language-based
systems~\citep{sabelfeld:language-based-iflow} or as tainting in secure OS.  In
this light, it is not surprising that {\LIO} treats objects (e.g. references,
synchronization variables, etc.) as flow-insensitive entities. Different from
other IFC tools~\citep{jif,FlowCaml,Hedin13}, {\LIO} utilizes public labels and
allows programs to query objects' labels without affecting the
floating-label---a useful feature to increase permissiveness when interacting
with external databases~\citep{giffin:hails}.

%% Contributions 
%Inspired by previous results~\citep{Austin:Flanagan:PLAS10}, 
In this paper, we adapt {\LIO} to work with flow-sensitive objects. To guarantee
non-interference, we demand the floating-label to get permanently tainted with
the label corresponding to the flow-sensitive objects being
inspected---regardless if it is their label or content what is under
scrutiny. While secure and novel, this mechanism facilitates label creep. We
present two mechanisms to mitigate this problem: an explicitly change labels
(inspired by \citep{Hedin13}), and a block-structured instruction which allows
using flow-sensitive entities without permanently tainting the floating label,
but enforcing their destruction after the execution of the block.  On the other
hand, in a concurrent setting, we simply adapt the {\nsu} policy to work with
\LIO. We argue, by showing an attack, that no-sensitive-upgrades is the most
permissive policy for scenarios where actions are forbidden based on threads'
local data---an essential requirement to obtain performance and
scalability. Although developed for {\LIO}, we believe that our approaches might
apply to other language-based floating-label
systems~\citep[e.g.][]{10.1109/SP.2013.10} as well as IFC OS work.  More
concretely, the contribution of this paper are as follows.
\begin{itemize}

\item An extension to incorporate flow-sensitive objects in {\LIO}. As a result,
  not only increase {\LIO} its permissiveness, but it provides means for safely
  combining flow-insensitive and flow-sensitive objects.


\item An attack that nails down the complications of having flow-sensitive
  objects in presence of concurrency.

\item Provably non-interference. 

\item An implementation of our ideas in Haskell, where programmers can write
  routines \emph{parametric} on the flow-sensitivity of objects---a novelty for IFC
  tools. 
\end{itemize}
