%% Flow-sensitive monitors 
Hunt and Sands~\citep{Hunt:2006} show the equivalence (modulo code
transformation) between flow-sensitive and flow-insensitive type-systems. In a
dynamic setting, Russo and Sabelfeld~\citep{Russo:2010} formally pin down the
menace of mutuable label for purely dynamic monitors. They prove that monitors
require static analysis in order to be more permissive than traditional
flow-sensitive type-systems. Targeting purely dynamic monitors, Austin and
Flanagan~\citep{Austin:Flanagan:PLAS10} provide the label changes policies
\emph{\nsu} and \emph{\pu}, where the latter is provably more permissive
(i.e. it rejects less suspicious programs) than the former. The discipline
{\nsu} stops the execution on any attempt to change the label of a public
variable inside a secret context. In contrast, {\pu} allows such changes but
marking the altered variables so that the program cannot branch on
them. Unfortunately, none of the mentioned work so far consider
concurrency. Different from {\pu}, our approach for sequential settings does not
require programs to stop at branches nor use extra security levels to indicate
mutation of labels. Austin and Flanagan propose a \emph{privatization} operation
to boost the permissiveness of {\pu}.  However, it is not clear how such
technique generalizes to arbitrary lattices.  

%% Breeze
Recently, Hritcu et al.~\citep{10.1109/SP.2013.10} propose a floating-label
system called Breeze. It allows label changes in the current label (i.e. pc) and
consider flow-insensitive objects. Given the design similarities with
\LIO~\citep{stefan:lio}, we believe that our results could be easily adapted to
Breeze.

%% JSFlow
In a web scenario, and focusing on reducing the number of rejected web pages,
Hedin et al. \citep{Hedin13} recently develop JSFlow, a IFC flow-sensitive
monitor for JavaScript. The monitor utilizes the label changing policy
{\nsu}. To overcome some of the restrictions imposed by this discipline, the 
primitive \textbf{upgrade} is introduced to explicitly change labels. The
flow-sensitive version of {\forkLIO} can be seen as an application of
\textbf{upgrade} every time that the current label gets raised.
