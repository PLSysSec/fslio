- Use |LIO| when referring to the LIO monad or LIO types
- Use LIO (no emphasis) when referring to the LIO system
- Use ~ before a \cite; make sure that it's blah~\cite{blah} not blah
  ~\cite{blah} though
- When using --- there should not be any space on the left or right
  (nor should the right hand side be followed by a , or .)
- Put notational stuff in the correpsonding file; main is too
  cluttered
