\begin{abstract}
  Flow-sensitive analysis for information-flow control (IFC) allow to change the
  security annotations associated to data structures. This feature is beneficial
  for several reasons: it often boosts permissiveness, reduce the burden of
  explicit annotations, and enables the reuse of single-threaded data
  structures. In a purely dynamic setting, although attractive, changes on
  labels can become a covert-channel capable to leak secrets at a high
  rate. 
  %Existing language-based solutions cover sequential languages, where it
  %is forbidden to either change the labels of certain flow-sensitive variables
  %or branch on them.  
  We present an extension for LIO---a floating-label system based on ideas from
  the operating system domain---capable to securely handle flow-sensitive
  references. The key insight is considering labels as being composed of two
  elements: a label indicating the confidentiality of data, and another label,
  called \emph{the label on the label}, which describes the confidentiality of
  the data's label itself. With this model, our approach allows label changes
  subject to the {\nsu} policy. Additionally, we consider operations to upgrade
  labels in safe situations and automatic places where to trigger them. As a
  surprising result, we prove that {\nsu} and upgrade operations can be encoded
  by using flow-insensitive concepts---for that, we leverage the ability of LIO
  to have nested labeled values.
%the structure of the security lattice (e.g. no relabeling of
%secrets as public data) and branches on altered flow-sensitive variables.
% Differently from mainstream IFC tools, {\LIO} allows to query the security
% labels associated to entities. 
% This feature becomes particularly important to
% secure in presence of flow-sensitive entities.
  In addition, we extend our solution for concurrent systems almost naturally,
  but with a subtle difference to avoid the termination channel. 
% We show, by an attack, that \emph{{\nsu}} is the most suitable
% discipline for label changes where execution is stopped only based on threadsâ€™
% local data---an essential requirement to obtain performance and scalability.
